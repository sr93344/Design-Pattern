1. Design patterns are split into three categories.
2. This is called Gamma Categorization after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors.

**********Creational Patterns*************
1. Deal with the creation (construction) of objects.
2. Explicit (construction) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.).
3. Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step).

***********Structural Patterns******************
1. Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members).
2. Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface.
3. Stress the importance of good API design.

***********Behavioral Patterns*****************
1. There are all different, no central theme.
