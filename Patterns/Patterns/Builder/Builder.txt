****Builder****
1. Some objects are simple and can be created in constructor call.
2. Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create.
3. Having an object with 10 constructor argument is not productive.
4. Instead opt for peicewise constructor.
5. Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step.

Builder - When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly. 
e.g., - HtmlBuilder.

****FluentBuilder****
